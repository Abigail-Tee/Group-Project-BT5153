Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer.

      "It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death. Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud.<br />--scholastic.com\n",

      "Tess Gerritsen left a very successful career as an internist to raise her children and devote more time to writing. <i>The Surgeon</i>, following several books that met with moderate success, is a gruesome and frightening story that should put Gerritsen among the top women thriller writers working today. <p> A serial killer is on the loose in Boston. The victims are killed in a particularly nasty way: cut with a scalpel on the stomach, the intestines and uterus removed, and then the throat slashed. The killer obviously has medical knowledge and has been dubbed \"the Surgeon\" by the media. Detective Thomas Moore and his partner Rizzoli of the Boston Homicide Unit have discovered something that makes this case even more chilling. Years ago in Savannah a serial killer murdered in exactly the same way. He was finally stopped by his last victim who shot him as he tried to cut her. That last victim is Dr Catherine Cordell, who now works as a cardiac surgeon at one of Boston's prestigious hospitals. As the murders continue, it becomes obvious that the killer is drawing closer and closer to Dr Cordell, who is becoming so frightened that she is virtually unable to function. But she is the only person who can help the police catch this copycat killer. Or is it a copycat? To complicate matters even further, Detective Moore, often referred to as Saint Thomas as he continues to mourn the loss of his wife, is getting emotionally involved with the doctor. </p><p> The suspense in <i>The Surgeon</i> is almost unbearable. The writing is superb and the stunning twists and turns make it almost impossible to put down. --<i>Otto Penzler, Amazon.com</i></p>\n",

The precision of the killer's methods suggests he is a deranged man of medicine, propelling the Boston newspapers and the frightened public to name him \"The Surgeon.\"<br /><br />The cops' only clue rests with another surgeon, the victim of a nearly identical crime. Two years ago, Dr. Catherine Cordell fought back and killed her attacker before he could complete his assault. Now she hides her fears of intimacy behind a cool and elegant exterior and a well-earned reputation as a top trauma surgeon. <br /><br />Cordell's careful facade is about to crack as this new killer recreates, with chilling accuracy, the details of Cordell's own ordeal. With every new murder he seems to be taunting her, cutting ever closer, from her hospital to her home. Her only comfort comes from Thomas Moore, the detective assigned to the case. But even Moore cannot protect Cordell from a brilliant hunter who somehow understands--and savors--the secret fears of every woman he kills.\n",

And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice and love. Told from a riveting dual perspective, Allegiant, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.\n",

      "A <em>New York Times</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, and <em>Publishers Weekly</em> bestseller, this exciting finale to Lauren Oliver's acclaimed Delirium trilogy is a riveting blend of nonstop action and forbidden romance in a dystopian United States. With lyrical writing, Lauren Oliver seamlessly interweaves the peril that Lena faces with the inner tumult she experiences after the reappearance of her first love, Alex, the boy she thought was dead. Named an Amazon Best Book of the Year, this sophisticated and wide-ranging novel brings the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Delirium trilogy to a thrilling conclusion.<br /><br />Now an active member of the resistance, Lena has transformed. The nascent rebellion that was underway in <em>Pandemonium</em> has ignited into an all-out revolution in <em>Requiem</em>, and Lena is at the center of the fight. After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends fled to the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven. Pockets of rebellion have opened throughout the country, and the government cannot deny the existence of Invalids. Regulators infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels.<br /><br />As Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain of the Wilds, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life in Portland as the fiancée of the young mayor. <em>Requiem</em> is told from both Lena and Hana's points of view. They live side by side in a world that divides them until, at last, their stories converge.\n",

We often romanticize the past as a gentler time -- but not so for the characters -- living or dead -- in The Book of Beloved. Lies and secrets are revealed. A sense of 'What Could Have Been' haunts the reader but ultimately the the search for truth prevails in a thoroughly fun read. So glad this is the first in a series!\n",

Some of the drawings are, in my opinion, not very well done. It's an ok book, but perhaps not quite as good as some other books on fairies that I have seen.\n",

      "The writing talent of Forsyth is evident here but unfortunately he misses the mark with this novel. He is known for developing a storyline slowly but in this case the story moves just too slow. The first half of the book is spent on character development of the Afghan prisoner who plays no role in the actual terrorist plot. The reader gets a thorough history lesson on armed conflict in Afghanistan but again that is not relevant to what the novel is suppose to be about.\n",

They know nothing about the attack: the what, where or when. They have no sources in Al Qaeda, and it's impossible to plant someone. Impossible, unless . . .<br /><br />The Afghan is Izmat Khan, a five-year prisoner of Guantanamo Bay and a former senior commander of the Taliban. The Afghan is also Colonel Mike Martin, a 25-year veteran of war zones around the world, a dark, lean man born and raised in Iraq. In an attempt to stave off disaster, the intelligence agencies will try to do what no one has ever done before - pass off a Westerner as an Arab among Arabs - pass off Martin as the trusted Khan.<br /><br />It will require extraordinary preparation, and then extraordinary luck, for nothing can truly prepare Martin for the dark and shifting world he is about to enter. Or for the terrible things he will find there . . .<br /><br /><i>The Day of the Jackal</i>,<i> The Dogs of War</i>,<i> The Odessa File</i> - the books of Frederick Forsyth have helped define the international thriller as we know it today. Combining meticulous research with crisp narratives and plots as current as the headlines, Forsyth shows us the world as it is, in a way that few have ever been able to equal.<br /><br />And the world as it is today is a very scary place . . .\"]\n",

      "An interesting book which starts at the end of the life of the main character who dies of cancer. Going back in a series of short stories the book covers the career of Kwan Chun-dok and his unnerving capability of deduction to solve various crimes. Often the motives behind the crimes are complex and Kwan adopts some unorthodox ways to solve the various conundrums. The book also covers some significant events in recent Hong Kong history and questions the direction the HK police force is taking. Quite an interesting book.\n",

      "['From award-winning Hong Kong writer Chan Ho-kei, <em>The Borrowed</em> tells the story of Kwan Chun-dok, a Hong Kong detective who rises from constable to senior inspector over the span of several decades, from the 1960s to the present day, and becomes a legend in the force, nicknamed “the Eye of Heaven” by his amazed colleagues. Divided into six sections told in reverse chronological order — each of which covers an important case in Kwan’s career and takes place at a pivotal moment in Hong Kong history — the novel follows Kwan from his experiences during the Leftist Riot in 1967, when a bombing plot threatens many lives; the conflict between the HK Police and ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) in 1977; the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989; the Handover in 1997; and the present day of 2013, when Kwan is called on to solve his final case, the murder of a local billionaire, while Hong Kong increasingly resembles a police state. Along the way we meet Communist rioters, ultraviolent gangsters, stallholders at the city’s many covered markets, pop singers enmeshed in the high-stakes machinery of star-making, and a people always caught in the shifting balance of political power, whether in London or Beijing.<br /><br /><em>The Borrowed</em> reveals just how closely everything is connected, how history always repeats itself, and how we have come full circle to repeat the political upheaval and societal unrest of the past. It is a gripping, brilliantly constructed novel from a talented new voice.']\n",

      "['Descended from an ancient race, Earth’s few remaining Lightkeepers battle the forces of darkness that threaten humanity... <br /> <br />Detectives Micki Dare and Zach Harris are called in to investigate when a millionaire developer leaps from atop his luxury hotel on the night of its grand opening. <br /> <br />After Micki receives a mysterious package from her long-dead mentor, and Zach suspects something supernatural working against them, they realize this is no ordinary case. A dark force is once again threatening the Big Easy. <br /> <br />Aspects of this case prove eerily similar to an unsolved murder from years before, making the stakes dangerously personal for Micki. This time it’s her life on the line. <br /> <br />It will take the ingenuity and special skills of their misfit band of light beings and humans to bring this perpetrator down...but can they do it before they lose one of their own? <br /> <br /> <br />About the Author: <br /> <br />Erica Spindler is the New York Times and International Chart bestselling author of thirty-three novels and three eNovellas. Published around the globe, she has been called the “The Master of Addictive Suspense” and “Queen of the Romantic Thriller.” <br /> <br />The Lightkeepers is Erica’s first series, something she’s wanted to do for years. All she was waiting for was the right characters. She found them in Micki Dare, reformed southern belle turned kick-ass cop, and Zach “Hollywood” Harris, a charming bad-boy with some very cool, save-the-world skills. <br /> <br />Erica splits her writing time between her New Orleans area home, her favorite coffeeshop, and a lakeside writing retreat. She’s married to her college sweetheart, has two sons and the constant companionship of Roxie, the wonder retriever. <br /> <br />Erica is currently at home in New Orleans, writing Micki and Zach’s next adventure. <br /> <br />Learn more about Erica online at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ericaspindler.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ericaspindler.com</a> or join the conversation on Facebook at Erica Spindler, Author. <br />']\n",

      "As with the previous 5 books, I continue to enjoy the biblical stories as told by Brian Godawa. He makes them come alive and this one is no different. I love the story of Caleb, someone who felt he was an outsider, used by God as a mighty warrior. I also love the redemptive story of Rahab and how, despite her history, she birthed a son in the lineage of Jesus. Love, redemption, miracles and in the center of it all, a Mighty God, whom we serve. I can't wait for the last 2 books in the series! Highly recommended!Read all the books in the series...you'll be glad you did!\n",

Moses has died, the Israelites stand poised to invade Canaan. Their first target: The impenetrable mighty walls of Jericho.<br /><br />But God has been preparing a pagan harlot named Rahab to help Israel. They soon discover through prophecy that she is a crucial link to God's plan of redemption for the Seed of Abraham. And she has fallen in love with an Israelite warrior whose child she bears.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Anakim giants of Canaan have also discovered Rahab's identity and have sent assassins to take her out.<br /><br />At the same time, Joshua and Caleb assault the Anakim stronghold and face the tallest, most ruthless of all giants: The brothers Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai.<br /><br />Worse yet, the patron deity of the Anakim is the storm god Ba'al. They're going to need the archangels' help or they haven't got a chance.<br /><br />This is what the War of the Seed has been building towards.<br /><br /><br />Part of the Biblical Fantasy Series Chronicles of the Nephilim<br /><br />Caleb Vigilant is the sixth book of the Biblical Fantasy Series Chronicles of the Nephilim, an epic story that begins with Enoch and Noah and tells the Biblical storyline of the Genesis 6 Nephilim giants, hybrid offspring of the angelic Watchers mating with human women.<br /><br />In Caleb Vigilant, you'll discover:<br /><br />* The romantic story of Rahab and how she fits into the plan of the Promised Seed of Abraham.<br /><br />* How the Nephilim giants of Genesis 6 are related to Israel's conquest of Canaan.<br /><br />* The legend of the Anakim, Israel's fiercest enemies in Canaan, the Promised Land.<br /><br />* The story of the infamous giant Anakim warriors, Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai mentioned in the Bible.<br /><br /><br />Learn About the Historical and Biblical Research Behind the Novel<br /><br />Author Godawa shares the scholarly research that undergirds the fictional adventure. Caleb Vigilant as an appendix that explores how the Bible writers used their literary skills to subvert the pagan god Ba'al of Canaan.<br /><br /><br />Biblical Fantasy Based on History and Ancient Mythology<br /><br />Caleb Vigilant is written in the spirit of The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings, blending fantasy and mythopoeia with history to retell the Biblical narrative with a fresh perspective, making it come alive in a new way, while staying true to the original spirit of the Bible story.<br /><br />It's like connecting the dots and filling in the story between the lines of what the Bible tells us.\"]\n"

      "Parts of this were thrilling, especially for those of us familiar with the histories of most of the characters involved. This world of the \"Marvel Universes\" which for me is something of a cross between mythology and soap opera, this world of powers and personalities can be magical if it is handled consistently both in terms of content and quality. Quality is one thing that is lacking at times in these story compilations with many different writers and artists, so while I really dug this on the whole, there were parts that could have been stronger.\n",
