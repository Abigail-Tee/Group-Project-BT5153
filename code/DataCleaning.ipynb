      "Renowned sportswriter David Goldblatt has been hailed by the Wall Street Journal for writing \"with the expansive eye of a social and cultural critic.\" In The Games Goldblatt delivers a magisterial history of the biggest sporting event of them all: the Olympics. He tells the epic story of the Games from their reinvention in Athens in 1896 to the present day, chronicling classic moments of sporting achievement from Jesse Owens to Nadia Comaneci, the Miracle on Ice to Usain Bolt. He goes beyond the medal counts to explore how international conflicts have played out at the Olympics, including the role of the Games in Fascist Germany and Italy, the Cold War, and the struggles of the postcolonial world for recognition. He also tells the extraordinary story of how women fought to be included on equal terms, how the Paralympics started in the wake of World War II, and how the Olympics reflect changing attitudes to race and ethnicity.\n",

      "The authors of this timely and provocative book use the tools of economic analysis to examine the formation and change of political borders. They argue that while these issues have always been at the core of historical analysis, international economists have tended to regard the size of a country as \"exogenous,\" or no more subject to explanation than the location of a mountain range or the course of a river. Alesina and Spolaore consider a country's borders to be subject to the same analysis as any other man-made institution. In <i>The Size of Nations</i>, they argue that the optimal size of a country is determined by a cost-benefit trade-off between the benefits of size and the costs of heterogeneity. In a large country, per capita costs may be low, but the heterogeneous preferences of a large population make it hard to deliver services and formulate policy. Smaller countries may find it easier to respond to citizen preferences in a democratic way. Alesina and Spolaore substantiate their analysis with simple analytical models that show how the patterns of globalization, international conflict, and democratization of the last two hundred years can explain patterns of state formation. Their aim is not only \"normative\" but also \"positive\"--that is, not only to compute the optimal size of a state in theory but also to explain the phenomenon of country size in reality. They argue that the complexity of real world conditions does not preclude a systematic analysis, and that such an analysis, synthesizing economics, political science, and history, can help us understand real world events.\n",

      "<i>Epicene </i>is now one of the most widely-studied of Johnson’s plays. Brilliantly exploiting the Jacobean convention whereby boys played female roles, it satirizes the newly fashionable and sexually ambiguous world of the West End of London, where courtly wit rubs shoulders with commercial values.<br /><br />This authoritative new edition, now in paperback, is based on a thorough re-examination of the earliest texts. The introduction analyzes the play as originally written for the newly formed Children of the Queen’s Revels, and performed at the little--known Whitefriars Theatre. Dutton discusses the composition of the play, which took place during a critical period in Jonson’s life and career, when he was established as the principal writer of entertainments at the court. His relationships at this time, with ambitious wits such as John Donne, Sir Edward Herbert and the actor Nathan Field, are examined as models for the principal characters. This challengingly historicized text of Epicene will be essential reading for all serious students of early modern drama.\n",

Her partner, Susan, has been brutally murdered and Tanner is convinced that it was a case of mistaken identity—that she was the real target. The murderer’s motive might have something to do with Tanner’s recent work on a string of cold-case honor killings she believes to be related. Tanner is now on compassionate leave but insists on pursuing the case off the books and knows Thorne is just the man to jump into the fire with her. He agrees but quickly finds that working in such controversial territory is dangerous in more ways than one. And when a young couple goes missing, they have a chance to investigate a case that is anything but cold.<br /><br />Racing towards a twist-filled ending, <i>Love Like Blood</i> is another feat of masterful plotting from one of Britain’s top crime novelists.\n",

Jane Alison in her fresh, original book about narrative is our new Aristotle.\" ―Edmund White, author of <i>The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading</i><br /><br /><i></i>As Jane Alison writes in the introduction to her insightful and appealing book about the craft of writing: \"For centuries there's been one path through fiction we're most likely to travel―one we're actually told to follow―and that's the dramatic arc: a situation arises, grows tense, reaches a peak, subsides...But something that swells and tautens until climax, then collapses? Bit masculo-sexual, no? So many other patterns run through nature, tracing other deep motions in life. Why not draw on them, too?\"<br /><br />W. G. Sebald's <i>Emigrants</i> was the first novel to show Alison how forward momentum can be created by way of pattern, rather than the traditional arc―or, in nature, wave. Other writers of nonlinear prose considered in her \"museum of specimens\" include Nicholson Baker, Anne Carson, Marguerite Duras, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Jamaica Kincaid, Clarice Lispector, Susan Minot, David Mitchell, Caryl Phillips, and Mary Robison.<br /><br /><i>Meander, Spiral, Explode</i> is a singular and brilliant elucidation of literary strategies that also brings high spirits and wit to its original conclusions. It is a liberating manifesto that says, Let's leave the outdated modes behind and, in thinking of new modes, bring feeling back to experimentation. It will appeal to serious readers and writers alike.\n",
      "<i>      New York Times</i> best-selling author Caroline Myss<b> </b>draws from her years as a medical intuitive to show that healing is not only physical; it is also a mystical phenomenon that transcends reason.<br /><br />      Inspired by ordinary people who overcame a wide array of physical and psychological ailments—from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer—Caroline dove into the works of the great mystics to gain a deeper understanding of healing’s spiritual underpinnings. Based on these studies, she demonstrates how conventional and holistic medicine often fall short in times of need. Both systems rely upon a logical approach to curing illness when there is nothing reasonable about the emotional, psychological, or spiritual influences behind any ailment.<br /><br />      Integral to this mystical healing approach is the engagement of the soul, which we experience through exploring our seven shadow passions, building an empowered inner self around our seven inherent graces, and learning how to work with the mystical laws that govern it. This knowledge holds the key to understanding what it means to defy gravity and break through the boundaries of ordinary thought.  You can heal any illness. You can channel grace. And you can learn to live fearlessly.<br /><br />\n",
      "When Zoe Walker sees her photo in the classifieds section of a London newspaper, she is determined to find out why it's there.

      "This fascinating book chronicles the making of the new record industry, from the boom years of the CD revolution of the late 1980s to the crisis of the present day, with particular stress on the last decade.<br /><br />It follows the actions and reactions of the major international record companies - five at the beginning of the story, now four - as they plowed their way through the digital slough of despond, bewildered by the fleet-of-foot digital innovators far more responsive to the changing marketing conditions through which recorded music was consumed and valued.<br /><br />These all have their significant place in Download but the real story is the structural change that has, almost surreptitiously, taken place within the music business.  This change, for reasons author Phil Hardy will explain in detail, has left the captains of the record industry as unable to act as they were unwilling to act.  In effect they became little but very well paid observers of the shrinking of their domains.<br /><br />\n",

      "Deep within the Pentagon, a covert, multi-billion arms-for-influence program was created. The objective was to protect the United States and its allies from terrorist acts by secretly enabling a hand-picked man to emerge as the most powerful leader in the Middle East.

      "In this monograph S.R. Cloude introduces, for the first time, the topics of radar polarimetry and interferometry. This topic was first developed in 1997 and has since developed into a major topic in radar sciences and its applications, in particular to space sciences. In its simplest form it concerns the study of interferograms formed by combining waves with different polarizations and their exploitation to infer important physical properties of the planetary surface being investigated.<br /><br />Written in three main sections, the first four chapters provide a detailed coverage of all major topics of polarimetry, including its basis in electromagnetic scattering theory, decomposition theorems and a detailed analysis of the entropy/alpha approach. The next chapter offers a brief introduction to radar interferometry, before developing in three chapters the important new topic of polarimetric interferometry. In this way it provides a complete treatment of the subject, suitable for those working in interferometry who wish to know about polarimetry, or vice versa, as well as those new to the topic who are looking for a one-stop comprehensive treatment of the subject. The emphasis throughout is on the application of these techniques to remote sensing and the book concludes with a set of practical examples to illustrate the theoretical ideas.<br />\n",

      "Books on Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss abound, as countless scholars have labored to uncover the facts behind Chambers's shocking accusation before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the summer of 1948—that Alger Hiss, a former rising star in the State Department, had been a Communist and engaged in espionage.<br /><br /> In this highly original work, Susan Jacoby turns her attention to the Hiss case, including his trial and imprisonment for perjury, as a mirror of shifting American political views and passions. Unfettered by political ax-grinding, the author examines conflicting responses, from scholars and the media on both the Left and the Right, and the ways in which they have changed from 1948 to our present post–Cold War era. With a brisk, engaging style, Jacoby positions the case in the politics of the post–World War II era and then explores the ways in which generations of liberals and conservatives have put Chambers and Hiss to their own ideological uses. An iconic event of the McCarthy era, the case of Alger Hiss fascinates political intellectuals not only because of its historical significance but because of its timeless relevance to equally fierce debates today about the difficult balance between national security and respect for civil liberties.\n",

      "<b>An authoritative, eye-opening look at Stone Age civilizations that explodes traditional portrayals of prehistory</b><br /><br />The rise of historical civilization 5,000 years ago is often depicted as if those societies were somehow created out of nothing.

      "Finally—the ultimate diet for fast, safe weight loss, lifelong health, and longer life, based on more than twenty years of research and the latest findings on appetite and weight. Metabolic specialist Ron Rosedale, M.D., has designed the Rosedale Diet to regulate the powerful hormone leptin, which controls appetite and weight loss by telling the brain when to eat, how much to eat—and when to stop. New research shows that leptin may be one of the body's most important hunger control mechanisms. Control leptin, and you control your weight.<br /><br />Most people's leptin levels are out of control, causing them to overeat and to store fat rather than burn it. The only way to flip the \"hunger switch\" back to normal is through a diet high in healthy fats and low in carbohydrates, saturated fat, and trans-fatty acids often found in processed food—plus just 15 minutes of daily exercise.<br /><br />Dr. Rosedale's 21-day diet plan is simple: Just select from the many foods on his \"A\" list, including \"healthy-fat\" foods such as avocados, nuts, olives, lobster, crab, shrimp, goat cheese, Cornish game hen, venison, and more. Then gradually add foods from the \"B\" list, such as steak, lamb chops, fruits, beans, and so on. A 28-day menu plan and more than 100 recipes, such as Dilled Salmon and Fresh Asparagus, Gingery Chicken Soup, Lasagna, Black Bean Wrap, Raspberry Mousse Cake, and French Silk Pie, make eating the Rosedale way deliciously easy.<br /><br />Weight loss is just the beginning. <em>The Rosedale Diet</em> will make you feel satisfied, reduce cravings, and put you in control of your \"sweet tooth.\" It can even help eliminate or reduce heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions associated with \"natural\" aging, as many of Dr. Rosedale's patients can attest. You'll find inspiring stories from them—and the power to control your weight and improve your health—in this groundbreaking book.\n",

      " kind of liking until the thing happens......the thing that just cheapens the entire story.I have been dying to read Everything, Everything. The reviews were all positive, it received a Kirkus star, it sounded so different... all these reasons added up to one of my most anticipated reads of the year. And it started quite beautifully-written with diverse characters, including an Afro-Asian narrator called Madeline. Madeline's condition aside - being allergic to the entire world outside her sterile home - it quickly became evident that the book wasn't as unique as I'd anticipated. It follows in the footsteps of the great doomed love cheesefest of our time - The Fault in Our Stars - and other clones like All the Bright Places.Unlike the aforementioned two, though, I found myself enjoying this book. It was more cheesy than sweet, in my opinion, but I still enjoyed the emphasis on the human need for more. I thought Madeline was incredibly selfish at times, but this offered complexity to her character and her yearning was palpable:“For the first time in a long time, I want more than I have.”“Wanting just leads to more wanting. There’s no end to desire.”I did get a whiff of instalove. It's like Madeline first sets her eyes on Olly and her whole concept of the world changes. But I did like the build of their relationship after this, through miming at the window, chatting online and sharing poems, jokes and philosophical musings with one another. Even if Olly is a classic manic pixie dream boy who exists only to make Madeline want more.And then... the thing. The twist that turns a story about an unusual, impossible relationship into JUST ANOTHER YA ROMANCE.\n",

      " (view spoiler)[Madeline discovers that it's all a lie! She isn't actually sick and her mother essentially made it up to protect her and keep her in the house after her dad and brother died (her mother isn't evil, just mentally ill).But it's so cheap because the author has built up this romance around the concept of one person having an illness that doesn't allow them to leave the house (an interesting idea) and then once they're all lurved up, she smashes the concept with a hammer and it crumbles into a story about two relatively normal teens in love. I thought we were doomed but... YAY, now we can be together! It was the laziest way to tag a happy ending onto the novel.Not only this, but how the hell did her mom get away with it for 18 years? Are we seriously supposed to believe that no one questioned it? Her mom is a doctor, but seriously - wtf?! She never had an official diagnosis! Did she never see any other doctors? This is set in California where I'm pretty sure they don't just let parents lock their kids in the house without some seriously good reason.

      "This book is about a the most special different unique girl half black-half-Japanese girl in the world who has a super ultra extraordinarily rare disease which nobody can figure out which makes her allergic to everything, therefore she has to stay inside all day, who meets a boy who moves in next door, and it is exactly as boring as it sounds. There is such a thing as trying too hard.I feel nothing for our doomed character. I don't really care that she could kick the bucket at any moment as she randomly develops an allergy to her clothes, her mom, the furniture. I don't care about her. I don't feel bad for her. She is sheltered, dull, emotionally underdeveloped. I have no fucks to give about whatever silly ass random hopes and wishes and dreams she has (go to Hawaii! Whoo! That's my dream too. Whoop de doo).There are cute little drawings! Whoo! There are book spoilers (the mouse in Flowers for Algernon died, and that book did make me cry in 5th grade).The Cute Boy Next Door(tm) sends her emails! They slowly fall in love! The end. It is that boring. Who gives a fuck?In all seriousness, I don't really read contemporary books, and I have criterias for them. They're supposed to make me feel for the main character. I want to suffer along with them. I want to fall in love along with them. I want to experience their joy, their pain. In a book in which a character is pretty much doomed from the start, I want to live each breath with them like it was their last.This book did nothing for me. There's a Bundt cake that \"commits suicide\" in the book. I felt more emotion for that cake than I did for anyone in this book.\n",

      "3 Stars. Unfortunately, I was a little let down by Everything Everything. I have heard people raving about it since 2015, I've been dying to read it since 2015. I can't exactly tell if it was just overhyped (by others and myself) or if the book just all around was not the best for me.The overarching positive thing I have to say about this book is that it was entertaining. Although I wasn't 100% satisfied with the story as a whole, I wanted to keep reading. It was addicting and amusing, and it was an enjoyable read. Also, we get a main character who is biracial (African American/Japanese). Biracial characters don't always get their own stories in YA, so I was glad to see some positive representation on this front. I also really liked Olly and Maddie together. I thought they complimented each other well. Olly was always looking out for Maddie's best interests and was respectful and attentive to her needs. These are the types of love interests we need in YA and I was happy to see them together.That being said, I was irked by quite a lot of this book. Firstly, I felt there was way too much of a focus on romance being Maddie's drive to \"truly live.\" I was very happy that at certain points, Maddie wanted to go outside for herself, to not feel restricted, and to be free. I may not agree with some of the risks Maddie took with her perceived condition, but if there was a reason for her to take those risks, a sense of taking control of your life and living for *you* is what I was glad to see. Unfortunately, I felt at a lot of time, that individual desire was overshadowed by a desire for love. There are so many points in this book where Maddie relays to Oly that she (view spoiler)[ \"never would have gone outside if it wasn't for him\", \"wanted Olly to have a girlfriend who could do the same things as him\" etc.  (hide spoiler)] I felt that there was too much of a focus on the presence of Olly shaping Maddie's decisions, and at times her personal discovery was overshadowed by her love for him. I left this book, not with the message that you should live your life to the fullest, but that Maddie was okay with sacrificing her personal health for love, and that's something I'm vehemently against. Had there been a focus on Maddie accepting she made risky decisions for Olly and that she had a new-found desire to make those decisions for herself only, I would have been more okay with it. But whatever efforts were made to squash the idea that \"putting yourself at risk is romantic\" were not strong enough for me to condone those actions.(This section technically constitutes as \"spoilers\" so I'll hide it, but if you've seen the trailer or know what decisions of Maddie's that I'm talking about, you won't be spoiled.) (view spoiler)[ I was somewhat appalled at how little Maddie seemed concerned for her health when she was outside and went to Hawaii?? Let me be clear that I do not have SCID, I have no experience with SCID or other medical disabilities, so what I'm saying here is HELLA IREELEVANT and just my personal interpretation. AKA I'm not attempting to speak for people with conditions like SCID. But I was truly in shock that Maddie did not often make enough comments, even to herself, about the impending risk of getting ill and dying? This girl has spent her entire life being told she has a high probability of dying if she goes outside. Yet she is in an entirely new environment, swimming in the ocean, in contact with people she has never met, eating new foods, wearing new textiles. I just could not understand how this girl could not be nervous 24/7 about getting sick when she has spent her life being told everything she is currently doing will potentially make her sick. It honestly took away a huge chunk of the authenticity of the story and felt entirely unrealistic in my opinion, but again, I have no experience with this matter, so maybe my perception is skewed and Maddie had fully reasonable reactions to her new experiences.  (hide spoiler)]Now we get to the issues with representation and research regarding SCID, which I'm not qualified to talk about, but feel it's important to address regardless.*I am incapable of accurately describing the issues of representation in Everything Everything.I read a review from Disability in Kidlit which wonderfully expressing why this book is harmful to people with disabilities. It spoils the ending for those of you that have not read it, but I feel it's an extremely well written review and I'd really recommend checking it out: http://disabilityinkidlit.com/2015/09... I've heard in passing that Nicola Yoon has addressed the issues in Everything Everything, but I'm unable to find any credible sources. If she has, that's great because 90% of authors do not do that.Overall, I liked Everything Everything. I had fun reading it. I liked the characters. I enjoyed the story. But I had a lot of issues with it, some deeper than I can personally convey. I personally prefer The Sun Is Also A Star and I would definitely read more from her in the future, but I just don't think Everything Everything lived up to my expectations.\n",

      "“Just because you can’t experience everything doesn’t mean you shouldn’t experience anything.” This was a combination of We Were Liars and The Fault In Our Stars. What concerns me is the We Were Liars part. Let me explain.This is a very dialouge-driven novel. Thoughtful but simple, cute and maybe a little cheesy. There's a whiff of insta-love but that isn't what bothered me. It's the plot.1. (view spoiler)[Madeline is sick. She cannot leave the house. Her mother does everything to keep her alive and far away from the world, because the Outside would kill her. Madeline however decides she wants do die so she can live. She leaves the house, runs away with a boy and leaves her mother a suicide note. God that was a bitch move. It made me so angry. Madeline acted like such a brat, and I hated her for it. (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[The twist. Turns out Madeline never was sick, her mother needs a therapist, and her whole life was a lie...and I still don't know what to think about it. I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. It just made everything seem so pointless. (hide spoiler)]There's one quote that I want to talk about, because it keeps nagging me even two weeks after finishing this:“Maybe growing up means disappointing the people we love.”I call that bullshit. Honestly it annoyed me so much. That's a pretty depressing world view. Every teenager should scratch that out of their head. Now imagine you're an adult, you have a child and you're so incredibly proud of it. You watch it grow up, learn things, achieve goals, make decisions. You think your parents are disappointed when they look at you? Nuh-uh, I guess they'll be looking at you thinking \"Look at that precious little human we created. Look at how bravely he/she/they just went to the grocery store and bought bread rolls\" or something along these lines.I'm sure I'll pick up Nicola Yoon's other works. I enjoyed her writing and her characters, and I hope she'll keep surprising me. Just in a more pleasant way.Find more of my books on Instagram\n",

      "I can see how this book might be offensive to some people (if you've read it, you know exactly what I'm talking about), but the author absolutely didn't mean it to be and it is just fiction. Plus, if we want to be mad at someone, we should be mad at a specific character. Just sayin'. When I first saw this book and read its synopsis, I mentally took a step back. ‘‘Hey, didn’t I read this one already?’’ A big déjà vu moment occurred. I, of course, was thinking of Magonia, which features a character with a similar disease… Except, in Magonia, the heroine is slowly dying but able to wander outside, whereas Maddy can’t leave her own house. As long as she doesn't and isn't exposed to the outside world, everything inside her functions normally. That being said, Magonia and Everything, Everything are two completely different novels that are worth the read.In fact, it reads so, so well. I started it thinking I would like to finish it sometime this week, but turns out I read it in less than three hours and I'm a slow reader. (Incidentally, uni is kicking my ass b/c of that.)I'm not gonna go ahead and say that the romance is a never-seen-before one, because let's face it. It's the usual boy-next-door story, but with a twist, seeing that the girl can't leave her house... I SO love that the heroine is Black and the love interest White. Interracial romances happen ALL THE TIME, and yet, they aren't as frequent in books and movies and I'm even going to go as far as to say songs. The writing is mesmerizing. TRY to resist it. And hey, there are cute little pictures. How often do you see those in YA? Try never. I have to watch the movie now... Do not disappoint me...Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin’\n",

      "confession time: i actually saw the film first before i read this, which i rarely do. but in this case, it didnt bother me at all! bookworm blasphemy, i know! :Peven though i already knew the story beforehand, the book still had plenty to offer. i especially loved the little nuances and details of maddys notes - it made the story so much more tangible and easier to accept, because lets be honest. this story is a little unrealistic at times (i guess thats the beauty of fiction). also, its very insta-lovey, but i thought the interactions between maddy and olly were cute and adorable enough to make up for it. overall, this kept me entertained and engaged. its short with relaxed writing, so this is the perfect book for someone looking for a quick and unique afternoon read!↠ 4 stars\n",

      "Buddy read with Mini-me!Ok. So this isn't my kind of book. There is literally nothing about the blurb that would tempt me to read something like this of my own free will. Unless this chick sported some mutant powers, came from another planet, or fought vampires in her spare time? No. Everything...everything...about this story sounds sappy and gross. Gonna have to give it a HARD pass.And let me go ahead and apologize to all the people who feel marginalized or disgusted at the way this book treated such a serious subject as this girl's illness. <--I get it. Not cool.However.My Everything is the 12 year old little girl pictured above, and after seeing the trailer to the movie, she asked me to read this with her.I know what you're thinking:But Anne, you have 4 kids! How can that one mean everything to you.I don't know! I love each one of them with all my heart. There's no science that can explain it, but it's true. Each one is the center of my entire world, each one is my favorite, and each of one of them is the best thing that ever happened to me. Why?Because I said so.It's Mom Logic. You don't argue with that shit.Anyway.She's always been my reluctant reader, so it wouldn't have mattered what the hell this was about, there was no way I was turning this opportunity down. So. Here I am, reviewing Everything, Everything.sighWarning: SpoilersSo this is basically a sugary Nicholas Sparks-lite romance for teens. Minus the horrifying endings that come with most of his books...Which is exactly what I thought it would be, and exactly why my 12 year old loooooooved it. And that's FINE. I mean, the only thing that I really thought was great about the story was the length. I was able to finish it in a day, which was a HUGE bonus because I'd promised her that I would read the damn thing before we saw the movie in the theater. Cha-ching! Slid in under the wire, just in time to sit through an hour and a half of teenage kissy face and fade to black sex.The ending is pretty controversial, but until I'd read some of the reviews, I really didn't understand why. Mainly, because I don't read shit like this. Ever. But I suppose it should have been marketed as a 'Mama's Fucking Crazy' story instead of a 'Sick Chick Falls In Love' story. Personally, I liked the fact that she wasn't really ill.And here's why:I got to lean over to my daughter during the movie and whisper, \"See?! THAT'S what a bad mom looks like! I'm not looking so evil for not buying you those (f-ing overpriced!) shoes now, am I?\"Damn straight.Ok. And this was the COOLEST part of the whole experience. After we left the theater, she turned to me and said the four little words I've been dying to hear her say for years:The book was better.Anyway, my kid gave it 5 OMG-IT-WAS-AMAZING! stars.I'm giving it 3 OMG-MY-DAUGHTER-VOLUNTARILY-READ-A-BOOK! stars.\n",

      "“Everything’s a risk. Not doing anything is a risk. It’s up to you.”I’ve had about 36 hours to think about “Everything, Everything” and now that I’m actually beginning to write this review I still don’t know how I feel about the book. It’s a really good and interesting story and to claim that it didn’t captivate me definitely would be a lie. So why do I have those mixed feelings? And why is it still so hard to sort out my feelings and thoughts? I really don’t know, but maybe this review will help me to realise what’s been missing. And there certainly was something missing, I just can’t seem to be able to put my finger on it. XDWell, I guess we’ll just have to find out, right? ;-)The plot:Madeline Whittier has been ill ever since she’s been born. She has a rare disease that’s called SICD and due to this illness she’s unable to leave her house. Just to get in contact with other people and even other things might easily be the death of her, so that poor girl is actually eighteen and has never seen more than the room she’s living in. Well, and the neighbours that just moved in… Of course their handsome and nice son Oliver has immediately attracted Maddy’s attention and if you think that the shit just hit the fan, well, then you’re actually right! *lol*”I keep picturing myself floating high above the earth. From the edge of space I can see the whole world all at once. My eyes don’t have to stop at a wall or at a door. I can see the beginning and the end of time. I can see infinity from there. For the first time in a long time. I want more than I have.”So far, so good! Now that this is settled we can finally move to the character’s section and I bet to write about them will help me to figure everything, literally everything out! (No pun intended, I swear! ;-P)\n",
      "Warning: From now on there are going to be many spoilers!!! So yeah if you don’t want to be spoiled you better don’t continue!!! XD\n",
      "The characters:”Is it always like that?” I ask, breathless.“No,” he says. “It’s never like that.” I hear the wonder in his voice. And just like that, everything changes.”Maddy:”Ever since Olly came into my life there’ve been two Maddys: the one who lives through books and doesn’t want to die, and the one who lives and suspects that death will be a small price to pay for it.”I liked the way she saw the world and thought about things. I loved that she was a bookworm and didn’t only want to see the world but also wanted to be an active part of it. I could understand her longing for more and I swear knowing about her complicated life I really, really, really felt sorry for her. Which she most certainly would kill me for, because Maddy is such a strong person and actually hates it to be pitied for being ill. After they came back from Hawaii my heart ached for her and to read about her struggle was so painful that I couldn’t decide whether I wanted to hug her or yell at her instead! I know why she banned Olly from her life and it definitely was the sensible thing to do… but well your head and your heart sometimes want different things and I think this is a life lesson Maddy had to learn the hard way. =(”I think of Olly, decontamination-cold and waiting for me. He’s the opposite of all these things. He’s not safe. He’s not familiar. He’s in constant motion. He’s the biggest risk I’ve ever taken.”Olly: I loved that boy ever since they moved in. Yes, for me it was insta love as well and to all of you who think this is impossible: No it’s not! You can fall for someone and you can fall hard and even though I know that many people claimed it was too fast I still have to disagree. Call it personal experience, but I definitely know what I’m talking about! ;-) So yeah, back to Olly! I loved his humour and the fact that he could be serious as well. I swear the story about “The Bundt” made me laugh so hard!!!”The thing about my mom’s Bundts is that they are not very good. Terrible. Actually inedible, very nearly indestructible. Between you and me.””I gasp. Did the cake just commit suicide? I crane my neck to see what’s become of it, but it’s too dark out. Just then a spotlight illuminates the cake. Unbelievably, it’s still intact. What is that thing made of?” *LOL* Just *lol*!!!That boy certainly was awesome boyfriend material and the more I got to know him the more I wanted him to be with Maddy! I mean seriously there is no better first boyfriend than a guy who’s funny, cheeky, quick-witted, brave, responsible and caring! Those two were just too cute together and I really wanted their ship to sail!! ”In my head I know I’ve been in love before, but it doesn’t feel like it. Being in love with you is better than the first time. It feels like the first time and the last time and the only time all at once.”Madeline’s mom:”How could you do this to me? After everything?”I want to say something, I open my mouth to say it, but nothing comes out. My guilt is an ocean for me to drown in. Oh man!!! Don’t even get me started! At the beginning of the book I really liked her relationship with Maddy and I thought that they were a good team, but the more I read, the more I began to dislike her mom! Yes, she wanted to protect her girl but she really could have shown a little more sympathy for her daughter! I mean that poor girl lived her entire life in a bubble and then she falls in love and all her mother does is to fire the only person who was ever really close to her. Looking at it in retrospective the entire incident with Carla definitely made sense and I still can’t believe that I’ve been so blind. Still, what Maddy’s mother did is \n",
      "U.N.F.O.R.G.I.V.A.B.L.E\n",
      "!!! I understand that she seems to have a mental illness, but damn if I’d be Maddy I’d be sooo angry at her!! No, scratch that, I know I wouldn’t be angry, I would be furious!!! How could she? How could she do that to her own daughter??? To her own flesh and blood!!! I can’t!!!! I can’t even put into words how much I loathe her for doing this to poor and innocent Maddy! ”I knew it was more than that. I had to protect you. Anything can happen to you out here.” She looks around. “Anything can happen to you out here. In the world.”Well and maybe I just found the reason why my feelings for this book seem to be so contradictory. As a mother of a child I know that the love for your little one is unconditional and true. You always try to do what’s best for your child, but in Maddy’s case her mother actually did something completely wrong. Sure, from her POV and in her mind her daughter was ill, but this still doesn’t change anything about the fact that she basically ruined her daughter’s life! With her actions she took away all of Maddy’s choices and in the end she even managed to make her ill. ”And it’s the wanting that pulls me back down to earth hard. The wanting scares me. It’s like a weed that spreads slowly, just beneath your notice. Before you know it, it’s pitted your surfaces and darkened your windows.”So yes, I think that’s the main reason why the book left a bitter taste in my mouth and resulted in the fact that I don’t know whether I liked it or not. The ending and the repercussions of her mother’s actions made me so angry, but then there was the fact that Maddy and Olly got a second chance at love and this actually made me hopeful and happy again. Do you see how much I’m struggling with this review? *lol*All things considered I still think that “Everything, Everything” was a very good book. Sure it had its weaknesses and flaws, but in the end this didn’t change anything about the fact that it was one hell of a page turner. I constantly found myself wanting to know what would happen next and when it comes down to it, this is actually one of the many things that make a good book, a really good book. Right? XD\n",

      "It's difficult to live when everything in the world kills you.In this moderately short but powerful novel we learn the story of Madeline \"Maddy\" Whittier, a fragile seventeen year old young lady with SCID, also known as the \"bubble boy\" disease.Isolated from the outside world, from everything, and everyone, Madeline lives secluded in a completely sterilized house; with a protective mother and a dedicated nurse that constantly checks her medical condition, since even the slightest alteration, even the most innocuous microbe, has the potential to kill her.Recluse in a house that she is never allowed to leave, life goes on relatively uneventful, until one day a dysfunctional family moves into the next house. And among them, a young boy named Olly.This external interference, will slowly change her life, unleashing a new world unknown before within her, and a passion to live, that carries, given her fragile condition, a sure risk of death.There are books that make you feel, think, and even tear, and this is one that includes a little bit of everything, with even some laughs as well. It left me with countless quotes and moments to remember. A memorable YA, adorable as few others.**** The movie manages to capture some of the book's spirit, but not really that much. Neither good or bad, just regular. Some important omissions and deviations were noticed. And the atmosphere felt a lot more early teen than young adult. Rue was also there. Interesting to complement the reading. At the very least I'm thankful they didn't butchered the book in the process.Still remaining, The Sun Is Also a Star, someday.Until next time,-----------------------------------------------Es difícil vivir cuando todo en el mundo te mata. En esta moderadamente corta pero poderosa novela conocemos la historia de Madeline \"Maddy\" Whittier, una frágil jovencita de diecisiete años con SCID, también conocida como la enfermedad del \"niño burbuja\".Aislada del exterior, de todo y de todos, Madeline vive recluida en una casa completamente esterilizada; junto a una protectora madre y una dedicada enfermera que constantemente revisan su condición médica, ya que la menor alteración, hasta el más inocuo de los microbios, tiene el potencial de matarla. Recluida en una casa de la que jamás puede salir, la vida transcurre relativamente sin sobresaltos, hasta que un día una problemática familia se muda a la casa contigua. Y entre ellos, un jovenzuelo llamado Olly.Esta intromisión del exterior, paulatinamente, irá cambiándole la vida, desatando un nuevo mundo desconocido dentro ella, y una pasión por vivir, que lleva consigo, dada su frágil condición, un seguro riesgo de morir.Hay libros que te hacen sentir, pensar, y hasta lagrimear, y éste es uno que incluye un poco de todo, inclusive hasta alguna risa también. Me llevo innumerables frases y momentos para el recuerdo. Un YA memorable. Adorable como pocos.*** La película llega a capturar algo del espíritu del libro, pero hasta ahí. Ni buena ni mala, veíble. Se notaron varias omisiones críticas, y algunas desviaciones importantes. Y el clima parecía mucho más early teen que young adult. Rue también está ahí. Interesante para complementar la lectura. Al menos se agradece que no masacraran la obra original.Queda pendiente algún día ojear The Sun Is Also a Star.Hasta la próxima,\n",

      "Alright, alright... four stars. Fine. I did it. We're good. But let's talk about how much I wanted to hate this stupid book. Oh I don't know, maybe because it borrows from like every popular young adult novel ever written. Funny illustrations, one sentence chapters, hipster chapter titles, nods to classic films and books, unique spins on popular board games, boys who wear black, Tumblr book reviews, mushy romance, wild unchaperoned craziness, the internet, super cheesy descriptions of how beautiful someone is, a boy describing himself as sexy, some rare disease that love can overcome, boy and girl falling in love but would never actually in real life so you have to really suspend belief, parents who just don't understand, teenage angst, a bright colorful book cover with giant title font, an author with a cool name, first person narrative...But why... why am I here 24 hours later having finished the book in two sittings and now somehow rating it four stars? God, I have no idea. I didn't even wanna read it. I put it on hold at the library for some stupid reason and when I went to pick it up they couldn't find it. I told them not to even bother because the book probably sucks anyway, and I'd rather read something much better. They insisted and went to check in the back and then came back after taking forever and handed it over. The bright, happy cover pissed me off and I almost threw it back in the librarian's face and told her to forget it. I'm not reading this garbage. It sits around the house for a few days. I finish a couple books, and it sits there beckoning to me from afar. I gave in. I read a few pages and then they just keep turning. I'm thinking about how I've seen all that stuff before. Move along. Nothing new to see here. Pages keep turning. The romance is so over the top and obnoxious. I keep reading. It kinda gets outta control. I keep going. The ending. I really enjoyed it. It's not the most original book in the world, but it far exceeded my expectations on a gray Sunday afternoon. Suspend belief and just go with it. That's what I always say. \n",

I can't give out spoilers! This book must be read!! Oh. My. God. I CAN NOT believe what Maddy goes through. And the ending! I thought I was going to have a panic attack reading what happens!!!!Madeline Whittier (Maddy) has SCID, basically meaning she is allergic to everything and has been sealed inside of her house since she was four-years-old or she will die. Her mother is a doctor and they have a woman named Carla that watches her when her mom is out. She has to take her vitals every few hours. They stand in an air-lock at the door until they are safely decontaminated. The house has filters, well you name it. This girl is 18 and doesn't know the real world.... until.... Olly moves in next door. He's hot, he's sweet and he is really good with Maddy. You know that they are going to fall in love and it's so sweet, it's so sweet and so damn sad. I can't take it!!!!! Hmmmm... what else can I say... shit... let me just say a little about the end but not too much. Maddy decides she wants to get out and see the world. She lies to Olly, gets him to go on a trip and things happen and she almost dies, but if these things didn't happen... if Olly didn't come into her life.... she wouldn't have found out the biggest thing she needed to learn about her life. And it made me cry damn it!! I love this book. Kudos to the author! \n",

Amazing idea, but the way the book was written (unrealistically) i was able to guess the outcome, which was frustrating because it could have taken such a better twist.

      " Can we first just talk about this cover??? Amazing right?! Stunning. It fits the story so well.Everything Everything is a novel about a girl named Madeline who is suffering from SCID... or as I knew it \"bubble boy syndrome\". Madeline has spent the last 18 years trapped inside her house. The only people she comes in contact with are her nurse Carla and her mother. That is until Olly moves in next door. Madeline is a very sweet lead. Also loved how diverse she is. She is a combination of Asian and African American, this set her apart from other YA characters right off the bat and was a huge plus for me. The other thing is her kind heart. I've read characters before who are caring, kind, and sweet but something about how Yoon presents Maddy's traits made it something special. She is a lead that you will easily be able to fall for. She was a lead that I thought I would mainly just sympathy for, but Yoon has this way of just making you more hopefully for her than anything else. Then we have Olly the adorable boy next door. He is another character that you will have no trouble liking. I did want a little more out of him, but overall happy with what he gives us. My favorite part of the whole book is with him and his mother bundt cake... So cute I found myself blushing the whole scene. Olly is charming, funny, and I think he seems his age. You might be a little confused about what I just said so I'll sum it up real quick... You know how in other \"sick kid books\" such a TFIOS a lot of people's issues with Hazel and Gus is that they speak so mature for their age and it's off putting for a few. Some get that it's because they are dealing with a more adult issue of realizing that they are going to die way before their time but some still think they seem a little too mature... So if you didn't like TFIOS for that reason Everything Everything might be more up your alley. Both Olly and Maddy feel, talk, and act more their age. Their relationship can be summed up in one word: Sweet. It's so so sweet. The fact that neither of them is put of by the others life situations is so endearing. You will be cheering for these two and without a doubt you'll want to see them end up together with a happy ever after. \n",

There was never a time when I didn't know what was going to happen next. As soon as Olly is introduced I was like \"well... I know exactly where this story is headed\". Sure enough I was waiting around for some kind of big surprise twist that I never ended up getting. So why the higher rating? Well because all of the adorable and perfectly placed extras. Yoon gives of these cute little sidenotes, little letters, poems and more. They're just wonderful and wiped away any \"errors\" I might have felt the plot had. And even with me saying that the book was predictable I really did enough the story. \n",

      "Everything, Everything is about a 17 year old girl named Madeline, who turned 18 in the beginning, who is pretty much allergic to the world, and the outside of her house. She has a rare disease called Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, SCID for short, or known as \"bubble baby disease.\" She's known as being allergic to anything and isn't able to go outside because she could either contaminate anyone she touches or anyone she touches. Her room is plain white including her shelves and walls, t shirts and shoes. She's lucky to have a computer, even though there's really no one she's able to talk to. The only people who are able to talk to her and touch her are her mother, who is also her doctor, and her nurse, Carla. They both know about her famous yet rare disease and known the triggers and sickness that come from it.Madeline is allergic to people as well. She takes online schooling and normally skypes with her teachers. She doesn't go to school because if she takes a step outside and feels the fresh air, wind, and weather, she could explode and pretty much die, according to Madeline herself. Something severe could happen and her nurse and mother have never allowed her to go out or have decided to risk themselves and see what happens. Neither has Madeline, until she met Olly.Olly is her new neighbor. He moved in right next to her and was known as an angel of death, a boy who wears plain black clothes—black t-shirt, black jeans, black shoes, and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. There isn't much about Oliver, Olly for short. He doesn't tell Maddy a lot (Maddie is Madeline's nickname he made for her) and there isn't much background information about him. All I know is that his father gets drunk and is one of those abusive and violent fathers and husband and decides to slam the door shut when he gets mad. Even though Olly said he has his secrets while Maddie has hers, hers were told but his were kept silent. As the two start communicating, kind of hating each other at the beginning because of the situation with Olly, his sister and Maddie's mom and the Bundt cake, they were able to form a friendship throughout emailing and somehow be able to meet each other. It all started with conversations, and they weren't awkward. Some were deep and some were just random, trying to make each other smile and laugh without being able to actually see it. Some were deep and full of secrets, wanting to not talk about the topic. Olly straight up tells Maddie he wants to meet her, so they both arrange meetings with Carla. Olly knows about her disease, sort of. She has told him that they can't touch or be really close to each other because bad things could happen to her, but Carla let him know again just in case. When Olly is waiting in a room and Maddie walks in, they both weren't exactly what they were expecting.Olly is muscular, and is pretty tall, not being able to show his full heigh when he's in another building, communicating. Madeline is the same Maddie, but to Olly she's different. She's beautiful and smart, and she's different than other girls he's fallen in love with. She has big, brown and curly hair while his is black and has his own curls as well. They both have their own similarities and differences, arguing in some but in a good way, being able to make up for them and become good friends.\n",
      "Little did Maddie know that meeting her next door neighbor would change her life, the way she looks at it, and the way she thinks about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respect. It's mother nature at her finest—awesome, beautiful, impersonal, murderous. Think about it: All that water and you could still die of thirst. And the whole point of waves is to suck your feet from under you so that you drown faster. The ocean will swallow you whole and burp you out and not notice you were even there.\n",
      "Madeline was a character I didn't completely enjoy reading about. I was confused about her personality and actions and couldn't tell if she was a stalker or not. I was asking myself is she was and thinking she was, sine she knew the schedules of her neighbors, including Olly, and would know where he is, what he was doing, and what was really happening at the moment. Other times, it was just open and anyone would be able to see since it was shown as publicity what was happening with Olly and his family. Her relationship with Olly was actually cute, even though it's a bit insta-lovish. I mean, she completely predicted her future and would know she would fall in love with him. She also thought he was attractive when they actually saw each other and would always be thinking about him, would be thinking about their emails, would be wondering if he would email her back or anytime soon, and would be wondering what he was doing or up to. Even when there was another girl at Olly's house, his friend or Kara's, Olly's sister, she would think she was someone trying to win Olly and take him from her, when he wasn't even with her or together in any way. Other than that, Maddy wasn't a realistic character because of her disease and her allergy to people, the outside, and the rest of the world, but her relationship with Olly grew and I was glad they were able to work things out throughout the book until the end. They had their cute moments and never really fought or argued, so I wasn't always on the \"something bad is gonna happen\" spot since I kind of knew nothing was gonna happen. Olly was pretty understandable towards her and was able to give her time and space when needed. But then we come again to Maddy being a little too caring, where she was thinking about Olly and wondering why he hadn't emailed her when she literally told him to not. I mean, she didn't completely, but asked for time and space because of a situation was having, yet she was in freak mode at some point because he hadn't emailed her. Why let him know you don't want to talk at the moment and then freak out because he hasn't talked to you?Olly was quite perfect in his own ways. His style is great, that's first. Like he would say, too sexy. He wouldn't wear any other color of clothing besides black and I was glad there was finally a book character that is similar to my type, where I just buy a specific color of any kind of clothing because it blends in with anything and is able to match with anything or its own. I can't tell if he completely fell in love with Maddie since she's the one who told him she's loved him since the beginning or something and he just said she was pretty when he saw her. I mean, just because he thought she was a pretty girl and he was wondering why she was looking out at her window, staring at him, doesn't mean he completely fell for her immediately after seeing her, like her. Other than that. Olly was understandable like I said. He didn't get mad at Maddie for lying to him when she needed to and would worry about her as well because she was outside, trying to defend him and worrying about him. He decided to go on a road trip with her when he knew the consequences that could happen and he would give her time to think. I was glad he wasn't a complete freak and didn't act a bit too imature for his age, unlike Maddie. Or maybe he was, but because there was no point of view from him I couldn't tell. I just knew he would worry about Maddie as well.Maddie's mom was a bit too controlling, and I was glad her relationship with Maddie kind of faded. (view spoiler)[She had been lying to Maddie her her whole and the worst thing is, Maddie found out herself. Her mother acted like she didn't know and it was all a mistake, but Maddie was never sick. There were no papers for proof and the only reason her mom pretended she was sick was so she could keep her to herself and not lose her like she lost her husband and son. She was a bit too controlling and everything would've been better if Maddie knew. Maddie's brother and father were killed due to a crash, not because it was a purpose. The driver was drunk, but Maddie would probably stay with her mom and keep listening to her like she always has. Maybe the relationship would've improved and been better if she knew the truth. I don't think it would be easy to make up a lie a mother had been keeping from her daughter for the past 17 years. The truth was found and I was glad Maddy decided to move on and literally move away, take some time off, knowing the outside world can't kill her and would only make her sick but no awful sickness that would end up killing her. (hide spoiler)]Carla was probably my favorite character. She was also understanding but she was really nice, positive, and encouraging. She would make sure Maddie was okay and would be okay and nothing happen would come along and happen. She would give Maddie positive ideas and positive encouragements, telling her positive things that can be used for the future and seen as real things. She was always there for Maddie, and she was one of her only friends. The writing wasn't my favorite thing. The doodles and pictures were something I did enjoy, but the story itself felt short. Some chapters were, the max, 5 pages long, and others were 1 or 2. I was always thinking why it was like that but then I realized the pictures took over them at times or other times the picture was the chapter. Besides that, the writing was a problem I had with the book, believing some things and trying to not believe others. It was also cute, but maybe that was the problem, I found it to be a little cute when it should've felt more realistic. Some lines were poetic and were able to blend in, but other times they felt too quick.\n",

      "When the ending doesn't matter...I, like a lot of you, I'm sure, totally called the ending of this thing before I even opened the book - and, for once, I didn't even care.  I really enjoyed this story and the characters. And I really love Yoon's writing style. The mixed media format was really fun and creative and I had a lot of fun with it. I have read a LOT of books in my life - over 1700 - and, I must say, this is the first time I have ever found myself physically spinning a book in circles like a total jackass to read some of the text. So that was fun.  Most of all, I just really liked how Yoon posed some good questions - is life without risk really living? - in such a smooth and lighthearted fashion. Anyway, I know this book has probably been reviewed and booktubed to death, so I'l stop there.  I have been on quite the high fantasy, YA fantasy, and YA fiction kick lately, so of course I already bought the other book this author recently put out. #NoSelfControlPrepare to be bombarded with random AF reviews, my friends. \n",

      "2.5 starsFind this review and others at A Thousand Lives of Frankie Lovely blogI really did not love this book really at all ... oops? The Story Madeline Whittier lives in a bubble. No seriously she suffers from SCID, also known as bubble boy syndrome. She has never left her house, her bubble. She has no friends except her mother and nurse. She is alone. Until one day, a black clad, daredevil boy moves in next door.What I Liked There were some interesting and enjoyable aspects to this story. I really enjoyed learning about Madeline’s medical condition, SCID, though I think I would have liked a bit more of this? Also I liked Madeline’s accounting of her day to day mundane and the difficulties of things that those of us without such medical complications often don’t even think about. I also didn’t mind Maddy and Olly’s developing friendship, but it felt like it moved way too fast and without enough development in place.What I Did Not LikeThe romance developed way too fast for my liking and then dove way too deep. It was a sweet budding friendship and attraction one day then it’s full blown infatuation the next. This is a problem. It’s not cute. The author never addresses this in any sort of negative way either which I found to be a bit irresponsible. I don’t actually see this as a lifetime love situation to be honest. Maybe a “I needed this at the time” sort of relationship. Olly is the catalyst for freedom for Maddy, but I do not feel like that means he is the rest of her life. And this girl is going to have some therapy to go through before she’s as stable as this book makes her out to be. I don’t know … I just felt like this “love of my life” thing was a bit much considering the situation and the age. But I'm an old lady so …I did have some plot issues with this book as well. *MEDIUM SPOILER* (view spoiler)[I found the trip to Hawaii to be a bit overly dramatic when this would have been the perfect opportunity to highlight the normal everyday luxuries that simply being free had to offer. I mean they are in Los Angeles, California for goodness sake. There must be plenty of things to do there. In fact … I think the story of the mundane luxuries would have worked anywhere … small town nowheresville even. I don’t know … I just feel like we could have done without the dramatics which actually would have fixed a lot of my plot issues. Issues like … how does a girl who has never been a part of the outside world ecru enough credit to apply for and be approved for a credit card limit high enough for this Hawaiian vacation?! Like … I'm struggling to get to Hawaii someday and she just applies and goes … no pre existing credit whatsoever and no cosigner needed. Must be nice I guess. (hide spoiler)]Also I had a bit of issues with the fact that she had no friends at all yet she was decent with the computer and had the internet. Why wasn't she in chatrooms and Facebook or ... Goodreads considering how much she loves to read? I would have been her internet friend. Poor girl. It just seems like a few basic internet searches or a word from her nurse Carla (who has her own teenage daughter) could have given her a bit of solace in her lonely day to day life. Another issue I had was with the plot twist … *MAJOR SPOILER*(view spoiler)[As it turns out, Maddy does not actually have SCID at all. Her mom imagined the whole thing as a way of coping with the sudden loss of her husband and son. No, I do not believe that dear old mother did any of this maliciously, it is quite clear that she acted out of fear and the desire to protect her daughter. She honestly believes it to be true even when evidence is presented to her. She is struggling with mental illness obviously … but this is never adequately addressed either. They discuss how her mother is sick in a way, but mom doesn't get help and the whole thing is pretty much glazed over. Not to mention that everyone starts hammering Maddy about forgiveness pretty much immediately. I feel like they needed to back off quite a bit actually! I am a huge proponent of forgiveness as a way to free yourself from negative energy, absolutely. Even when it is not deserved. But give the girl some space! She just learned that her entire life till this point was basically stolen from her by the one person in the world she thought she could always trust. Let her go through some therapy for a minute before we expect forgiveness geeze! (hide spoiler)]But even after all this, I felt like my major issue with this book had to do with my lack of connection to anyone. I just didn’t care. This book didn’t make me feel anything … and I’m an extremely emotional wreck of a human so this is actually quite rare. This book should have been a remarkable journey of first love and sacrifice and hurt feelings etc., but I just felt meh at best.In ConclusionI did not love this book. It is possible I didn't even like this book. There were a lot of plot issues and relationship issues but in the end it comes down to the fact that this book utterly failed at connecting with me emotionally.\n",

      "Second Read: August 11, 2017First Read: November 4, 2015Wow! I didn’t think I’d like it even more the second time around. Just look at the amount of time I spent copying quotes and excerpts and taking photos of the pages.  “WHO IS AFFECTED BY HAR? (Hysterical Abdominal Rhopalocera)The disease affects at least one teenaged American girl every 30 seconds”  and a particular 31 year old woman in the Philippines everytime she’s reading a sweet romantic read like this book.   “You’re not living if you’re not regretting.”  \n",

      "Time passing techniquesPre-Kiss ChecklistKiss Mechanics Creating the Correct Kissing AtmosphereHilarious right? Now that I already know the plot, I’m more empathetic with the characters and their motives. I no longer felt tricked or misguided by the plot twist and I have become more appreciative of the dialogues and the themes of the story. It’s also only now that I took notice that Ms. Nicola Yoon’s husband, Mr. David Yoon is the illustrator. How adorable is that? I watched the movie right after I finished the book and I quite liked it too. I think the actors gave justice to their roles. There was enough chemistry between them and I’m thankful they didn’t make the story seem so cheesy with their cute romance. I liked the cinematography for creative effect. Of course there are several alterations but only to minor details like Maddy’s hair is supposed to be really long while Olly’s doesn’t have a lot of hair except in the last part of the book. But you know me, I notice insignificant stuff all the time. Lol._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  Original Review  3.5 stars  Brief intermission Madeline’s question: \"Who actually slaps their knee while laughing?\"Aj’s answer: \"Uh, fifty percent of the Filipino population, I think?!\"  *slaps her knee while laughing* -end of intermission-^^Everything, everything about the first eighty percent of this book is adorable in a “this-is-so-cute-I-want-to-pinch and smooch you” way. The story line is something very new because Madeline, a half-Japanese, half -African-American teenage girl is diagnosed with SCID, a special kind of illness that makes the person highly vulnerable to infectious diseases. For this reason, Maddy for the entire 18 years of her existence hasn’t gone anywhere except her super sterilized home. Living life under such condition is unimaginable but Maddy has made it through because of her loving mom, caring nurse, love for books, passion for writing one-line spoilery reviews and her creativity in general. She seems okay with everything, everything until she meets her charming new neighbor, Olly, a young man full of life and energy. Everything, everything from then on is certainly never going to be the same. (I’m purposely trying to annoy you by saying “everything” twice.^^)The writing is completely charming and really funny. I enjoyed how the book was written like the most artistic journal complete with diagrams, dictionary (Maddy’s version) and illustrations. Its creativity is very entertaining which makes the reader want to keep turning the pages for more surprises that despite the succeeding paragraph, I’m still giving this a good score.I was a bit disappointed at the turnout of the plot. Actually, disappointed is downplaying it. I was frustrated that I had to stop reading for an entire day and when I picked it up again, some of the charm and magic of the book got lost on me. Also, that alternate sort of happy ending didn’t sit perfectly well for me. It ended too quickly and I felt like there were still certain important things that needed to be resolved.Still, the message of the story is very prominent and certainly moving. We may find it worn-out but no matter how we reverse the world, tilt it sideways or turn it upside down, the truth that “love makes the world go round” or in this case, “love makes everything, everything go round” will always be true and more often than not, love doesn’t make us go for the most rational decisions. Love in more ways than one is both ugly and beautiful and yet people still live with and for it. ^^Do check out Masooma's wonderful, wonderful review. <3\n",

      "Literally me trying to write this review:\"this book was......\"*backspace*\"I was so...\"*backspace*\"why was this book so good?....\"*backspace**backspace*....*tears out hair*(Now, after giving you a very detailed explanation of the past 30 minutes,here's my actual review!:)Ok. You've already seen my attempts at writing a review that won't bore you to death. But does this really matter when I'm this shook?? Repeat: I'm SHOOK! I really have no words, besides the fact that book was probably the most brilliant contemporary novel I've EVER read!! Maddy is a girl who has a mysterious disease where she is allergic to the world and people and everything in between. Including Olly. But we already know that this isn't going to stop them from talking and falling in love and all that stuff those star-crossed lovers do, right?? OF COURSE WE DO.So what happens??SHIT.The WORLD EXPLODES.OLLY AND MADDY CAN\"T BE TOGETHER.EVERYBODY'S FLAILING THEIR ARMS AROUND CAUSE THEY\"RE ARE CRAZY FANGIRLS/BOYS.See, you get the point. And what do crazy teenagers like them do??RUN AWAY. I swear, this is every teenager's life.They're plan is just:A. Run Away.*If plan A fails...then.....*B. Run Farther Away.*If that fails....*C. Run Even Farther to the 'Corner of the World'And the list just keeps on going!But besides they're insane, yet brilliant plan, they have fun. Which is probably squished in somewhere between plan B and C. They experience the ocean, the world, the love of one another, and honestly, it's great to read it. :) So if you're a sucker for romance, here ya go!And with this new found experience, here's when the shit happens! Whoopee.Maddy gets extremely sick, and unfortunately, shuts Olly out from her world. Now from here, I obviously can't blab on since it would break the rule of no-spoilers, but when you're done with the book, you also realize.....that the author left a lot of stuff out of this story too!!Like:What happens now??Is Maddy going to lie there forever??What about her sickness?WHAT\"S WITH THIS ENDING THAT HAS LEFT MY GIDDY, YET ANGRY AT THE SAME TIME??!!! WHAT\"S THAT ALL ABOUT??!!*calms herself*.....Great!! Reviews over!! This book was a brilliant, great read, so please try it!(and fangirl with me about Olly, and Maddy, and more of Olly........)*smiles maniacally*I swear I'm not a creep!! :)And now........leave me in peace to figure out this story and tear every last strand of hair out from my head.....\n",

      "Well, this was as YA as they get, with all the good and bad things that come with that.Let’s start with the good: the characters are likable. This is probably why I gave this 4 stars instead of 3. Both Maddy and Olly are interesting enough to make you turn pages. That being said, we have almost instalove here. Gosh, I wish I would understand why YA authors always do that. I’m not saying their love story is badly written. Just that it happens waaaaay too fast. Slow down! Make me care first!!The novel itself, plot wise, is pretty simple. At some point, before that twist, I was thinking it will go for the classic The Fault in Our Stars ending, but it actually managed to avoid that in a pretty clever way. Oh, it made me mad, but that is good. It means it made me care. So good job!Now look, if you are a YA reader you will probably like this. If not, it is a 50/50 gamble. I enjoyed this more in a guilty pleasure way than the fact that it is an actually a great book. It keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t really bring nothing new to the table. Make of that what you want.\n",

Her mom has no one else in the world to talk to and she's getting ignored because Madeline has a boy in her life. And really? Running away because you can't see a boy?And the VERY predictable end: not only is it predictable. Kind of dumb. It's hard for me to believe that she never talked to another doctor besides her mother about her diagnosis.Edit: Ah yes, they made this terrible novel into a movie! Lets show teenagers that it's okay to disrespect your parents for a boy and fly to fucking Hawaii, that's what we should do definitely since teenagers don't already disrespect their parents for no reason every day.\n",

      "I loved this book. It had everything, men, moods and money and maybe murder, very melodramatic. What more do you want in a Victorian potboiler? It would make a wonderful Hollywood movie Plenty of opportunity for some thin, big-eyed, dark-haired beauty to lean out of a window and emote, panting fetchingly as her bosom heaves up and down and her eyes fill with glycerine tears. This isn't a plot-based novel, but one that is full of detail and seems to be a realistic depiction of life for a young woman hemmed in by church, her tyrannical father, and what society expected from a young woman of means which allowed her very little freedom to follow her own path to happiness.This isn't the upper class of Virginia Woolf and their despising of people \"in trade\", this is the Victorian England of the middle class where the Protestant ethic of hard work is key to the exploitation of the lower classes in the pursuit of money. The financial industry, banks and investment opportunities are now all respectable and no longer need to be thought of with disgust by Christians, who had previously banned it for themselves but allowed Jews to do it and called them, \"money lenders\". If it was filmed, it wouldn't be able to be true to life because if there any two English accents many people find hard to understand, it is the Black Country first and Potteries second (Geordie third), and this is the Potteries. I'm British myself, so I don't know what an international audience would make of them. It would be a good film though, a blend of drama, romance and how the middle classes lived and worked in a manufacturing Northern town where the factories belched out smoke covering everything with a veil of grime. The only relief being Church on Sunday, where the sermons preached holy misogyny and kept workers in their places, praising those who wore the fancy clothes that the exploitation of the labourers afforded them.Totally rewritten 4 March 2018 after seeing the book on my shelves and remembering how much I liked it. I have over 2,000 books in my home so it can be years before I notice a particular title.\n",

      "As everybody knows there are just two types of people in the world, however as many suspect, there is some disagreement as to who they are. Some say the rich and the poor, others the hungry and the fed, a few with a touch of whimsy might suggest women and men, or old and young. If however you've a sense of the depth and breadth of the division between the reserved and the expansive, then you can appreciate the muted tones of this book.This is a novel in which small things said, or not said, count for a lot. It is a novel of small, tight, gestures. Every action, every word is braced under the weight of the everyday lives of the characters. Even the geographical scope of the novel is muted from the five towns, Bennet's fictionalised version of the six towns which eventually and, reluctantly, became Stoke-on-Trent, to the Isle of Man (view spoiler)[ almost spitting distance if that geography is exotic to you (hide spoiler)]. Our heroine is so locked in by the spirit of self-denial that no amount of money can ever allow her meaningful freedom from herself which is ironic given the course of the plot .I visited the Wedgwood Factory-Museum in Stoke many a year ago and was very pleased to see the that the young woman who was doing the painted hand-finishing to the crocks was as finely and brightly dressed as the women doing the same work are described in this novel. And I particularly like the offhand manner in which the end of a character is wrapped up appropriately for a book in which the characters are over shadowed by the power of money.This is a proper hard novel. Compromises are the best a character can hope for, happiness is not to be achieved in the five towns, leastwise not by the characters we are shown, though as the author's life demonstrated - sometimes it is possible to leave.\n",

      "A plot summary would make this short, but perfectly formed novel sound parochial, unoriginal and maybe dull. It is not. Bennett is a wonderful observer and writer of the small-scale aspects that make life real and characters spring to life. He's also pretty good at writing female characters. In fact, by far the weakest character is male: the faultless Henry Mynors. In many ways, my life is utterly different from Anna's, but in some key ways, I can identify with her more than I might wish to. This book is rather like a factory Anna visits: \"No stage of the manufacture was incredible by itself, but the result was incredible.\" This isn't one of his lightly humorous books (The Grand Babylon Hotel and The Card).Instead, it features a profoundly nasty man, who never lays a finger on anyone or commits any crime.Setting and PlotIt's as simple as it says on the back of the book: it's set in the English potteries district, in the early 20th century. Anna Tellwright is about to come of age, and lives with her wealthy, miserly, twice-widowed father (Ephraim) and young half sister (Agnes) in a Methodist-dominated town. Ephraim \"existed within himself, unrevealed\" even to Anna.Anna is dutiful, naive, lonely: \"the peculiarity of her position... awe and pity were equally mingled\" and unfamiliarity with social situations mean she is not \"a facile talker\".She inherits money, is taken under the wing of the Suttons, is courted by up-and-coming Henry Mynors, still cares about the fate of the less fortunate (Titus Price and his adult son, Willie), and is very unsure of herself. When invited to a sewing party, she is baffled by the etiquette: \"Should she arrive early, in which case she would have to talk more, or late, in which case there would be the ordeal of entering a crowded room?\" Who of us has not felt a similar dilemma, even with more experience?However, she is not mistress of her own destiny, and that is where the tension springs from.What is love?Anna's stirrings of love, her excitement and uncertainty ring very true: \"the man whose arm she could have touched... She had felt happy and perturbed in being so near him... already she knew his face by heart.\"She is afraid and excited, and everything looks different, \"She saw how miserably narrow, tepid and trickling the stream of her life had been.. Now it gushed forth warm, impetuous and full.\" She is even tempted to neglect her duty to her family (only in trivial ways).Henry calms many of her fears: he's wonderful with Agnes, and even with her father - teasing the former, and braving the latter (even daring to ask for more beef).However, just when she should be happiest, she feels \"no ineffable rapture, not ecstatic bliss.\" Despite her yearnings, Anna lacks passion, whether for a man or for God (see the Revival section, below). She tries to live as if she has it for both, hoping it will become true.I also questioned Henry's love for Anna: he seems too perfect and, given his strong religious faith, oddly unperturbed by her lack of conviction (though her dedication is admirable). Anna's love of her sister is unquestioned and unquestioning, but her feelings about her manipulative father are more complex: \"The worst tyrannies of her father never dulled the sense of her duty to him.\"MoneyEphraim Tellwright is a former Methodist preacher, but he's a very un-Christian emotional bully. The love of money is perhaps the root of his evil. He is a canny investor, a harsh landlord, and spends almost nothing, so his wealth has accumulated, and he's very proud of how well he's managed Anna's inheritance before she came of age.He is shrewd and crafty. He simultaneously minimises his donation to the Sunday school and entraps his indebted tenant by promising to match the tenant's donation. He will also \"promise repairs [only] in change for payment of arrears which he knew would never be paid\". When he hands Anna's inheritance over, he really does no such thing. He makes her pay cheques in, forces her to write letters against her will, and ensures she daren't ask for a penny for herself. When she wants her cheque book, so she can buy a few clothes to go on holiday with the Suttons, he refuses. Anna's own attitude to money is very different: she makes all her own clothes, has no servant or carriage, and uses nothing on her hair. \"The arrival of money out of space, unearned, unasked, was a disturbing experience.\" \"She wanted to test the actuality of this apparent dream by handling a coin and causing it to vanish over counters.\" The trouble is, she's now too rich to ask her father for any of his money, but she can't use her own, as he's tied her into a business agreement with someone. On holiday with the Suttons, she is startled by their \"amazing habit of always buying the best of everything.\"EphraimIt's not only money that makes him mean. Anna and Agnes live in fear of his temper. His \"terrible displeasure permeated the whole room like an ether, invisible but carrying vibrations to the heart.\" The mindset behing his bullying misogyny are chillingly exposed: \"The women of the household were the natural victims of their master\" who had \"certain rights over the self-respect, the happiness, the peace of the defenceless souls set under him.\" When she is engaged, he claims her suitor is only after her money.RevivalAnna has been raised a Methodist and teaches in Sunday School, but feels like an outsider as she's never had a conversion experience. Guilt is not just a prerogative of Roman Catholics. There is excitement at the prospect of a campaign, featuring a famous preacher with an \"ineffably wicked\" past: \"the faint rumour of that dead wickedness clung to his name like a piquant odour\". In preparation, Anna visits the families of Sunday School children and \"found joy in the uncongenial and ill-performed task\", both as a penance and because Henry asked her to do it. In the service, he \"had two audiences: God and the congregation\". The mesmerising techniques, Biblical exhortations, emotional pressure, guilt, and concern are carefully described: I didn't quite believe (in) him, but wasn't certain that he was a charlatan either: \"he had an extraordinary histrionic gift and he used it with imagination\". Poor Anna \"was in despair at her own predicament and the sense of sin was not more strong than the sense of being confused and publicly shamed... She heaped up all the wickedness of a lifetime... and found horrid pleasure in the exaggeration... She had never doubted... Jesus died on the cross to save her soul... What then was lacking?\" She is tormented by whether to go forward as a penitent, and more, by the knowledge she can't.When she most needs faith, it fails her. She can't turn to Henry, because he is too pureI have been Anna. I know all those services, techniques and feelings. I am now free (despite a painful glimpse back, via this book), and I wanted her to be too.ConsequencesThe key part of the plot is a factory, now owned by Anna, that is rented by Titus Price, a feckless man, deep in debt, with a sweet but ineffectual son, Willie. Ephraim is keen for Anna to keep squeezing them for the rent arrears - a task Anna is not comfortable with. Worse still, (view spoiler)[Ephraim adds further pressure and threats behind her back. When Titus commits suicide, Anna blames her father and herself - even though the inquest finds other factors, such as embezzling church money. (hide spoiler)] From this, everything in Anna's life is jeopardised. EndingGasp! I didn't expect or want a clichéd happy ending or a shockingly tragic one, but I wasn't expecting this, and I'm not sure how I'd describe it (a bit of both?), so I won't!Anna believes \"A woman's life is always a renunciation\" (not necessarily of what the reader expects). I don't think Arnold Bennett believes it should be, though. He was a man ahead of his time. Period SurprisesThe men (some shirtless) working alongside women in the pottery works was a surprise. More surprising still, was good Christians deliberately providing opportunity for a couple (not even engaged) to spend time alone together. Mind you, she did wear a \"skirt which showed three inches of ankle\"!Maybe my history is at fault, though; this was published in 1902, so it just sneaks into the Edwardian, rather than Victorian category. Quotes - Scenery and AtmosphereMost of Bennett's books are set in the area he knew well. He portrays small town politics, industry, rivalries, and even makes factories seem beautiful.\"Burning ironstone glowed with all the strange colours of decadence... unique pyrotechnics of labour atoning for its grime... enchanted air... a romantic scene\"!The towns are \"forbidding of aspect - sombre, hard-featured, uncouth; and the vaporous poison of their ovens and chimneys had soiled and shrivelled the surrounding country\" to a \"gaunt and ludicrous travesty of rural charms\". This then segues into something rather different: \"embrace the whole smoke-girt amphitheatre... this disfigurement is merely an episode in the unending warfare of man and nature and calls for no contrition... Nature is repaid for some of her notorious cruelties.\"Factories can be cruel, though. The women paintresses, a few \"die of lead poisoning - a fact which adds pathos to their frivolous charm. One paints nothing but circles, the \"summit of monotony... stupendous phenomenon of absolute sameness.\" Of those visiting a new park, \"people going up to criticize and enjoy this latest outcome of municipal enterprise... housewives whose pale faces, as of prisoners free only for a while, showed a naive and timorous pleasure in this unusual diversion; young women made glorious by richly coloured stuffs and carrying themselves with the defiant independence of good wages... a small well-dressed group whose studious repudiation of the crowd betrayed a conscious eminence of rank.\"Other Quotes* Leaving Sunday School, the teachers \"gradually dropping the pedagogic pose, and happy in the virtual sensation of a duty accomplished.\"* An ageing and charitable woman's \"bodily frame long ago proved inadequate to the ceaseless demands of a spirit of indefatigably altruistic, and her continuance in activity was notable illustration of the dominion of mind over matter.\"* A young woman of 20 \"had the lenient curves of absolute maturity.\"* A man of 30 had \"the elasticity of youth with the firm wisdom of age.\"* A spinster \"was lovable, but had never been loved... found compensation for the rigour of destiny in gossip, as innocent as indiscreet.\"* \"It seemed a face for the cloister... resigned and spiritual melancholy peculiar to women who through the error of destiny have been born into a wrong environment.\"* \"unconsciously-acquired arrogance of one who had always been accustomed to deference.\"* \"the quiet enchantment of reverie. Her mind... ranged voluptuously free.\"* An old dresser: \"Seventy years of continuous polishing by a dynasty of priestesses of cleanliness\" looked \"as though it had never been new.\"* \"The double happiness of present and anticipated pleasure.\"* Bad news spreads: \"All knew of the calamity, and had received from it a new interest in life.\"Old fashioned spellings:connexionmanikinto-day\n",

      "How do I explain why this is so very good? I do not want to wreck the story for you, and thus not too much should be revealed!This book is good at the beginning, but it gets better and better as you go. At the start, I made guesses about where the story was leading. Some of my guesses proved to be wrong!Bleak and grim are the appropriate adjectives to be used when describing this book. This may not suit all readers; this is meant as a word of warning. The writing is so effective, so atmospheric and builds with such force that I do not mind the gloom and the imminent feel of tragedy. What is described feels real and honest and “this-is-how-it-would-be”, so for me, perfectly right! Is it contemporary writing? No, absolutely not.One must pay attention to every word. Each word is there for a reason; every word counts. Arnold Bennett’s writing is unsentimental. This makes what happens bearable. I like the sparsity of the prose. This forces you to pay attention and makes you think. The setting of the tale is the late 1800s, middle England, Staffordshire. The towns spoken of in the title go by aliases in the novel. They are in reality Turnstall , Hanley, Burslem, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. You will exclaim—but that is six! Bennett eliminated Fenton because he felt the title sounded better with the word five rather than six. In this way Fenton has come to be known as “the forgotten town”. Anna, of the title, is of Bursley, the alias of Burslem. It is a pottery town. The book wonderfully describes the town “potteries”, the area, the era, the people and the pervading social climate. How people, women and men and individuals of different social standing, were expected to behave is made clearly evident.Should one read this story for plot or for character portrayal? For both or for either. Each character is well drawn. This makes you need to know what will happen to them, making plot equally important! The eponymous Anna is the central character. Her mother is dead. She runs the household for her miserly father, and has a younger sister named Agnes to whom she is as a mother. Anna is of the marrying age and has inherited money from a grandfather. The problem is she does not know a thing about money. She has been taught to obey, to follow instructions, to do as told and certainly not to think. Her father is as much a central character as she is. If you want to read a book having a character on which to vent your anger, read this book. I immensely detested this man. For this reason alone, I rooted for Anna. There is an assortment of other characters, some kind, some pitiable, some a mix of good and bad attributes often circumscribed by their situation. A good spread of characters, giving a realistic picture of townsfolk in the time and geographical area depicted. I thought a lot about Anna’s inability to feel the sentiments of love and passion. I view this an important element of the story. Why is she this way? Why did she feel as she did about her suitor? Why was she drawn to both him and then (view spoiler)[Willie (hide spoiler)]? Isn’t it understandable that she should first feel (view spoiler)[motherly love and that only later could this be transformed into passion toward a mate? Was she even able to recognize love growing up alongside her father (hide spoiler)]? So yes, character portrayal is an essential part of the story.Caring for the characters as I did, I needed to also know what would happen to them and how the story would end.The ending. As stated before, you must pay attention. If you do not, you will miss what has happened. Don’t read the next spoiler if you plan on reading the book! Anna’s love (view spoiler)[for Willie is transformed by a look, by one brief moment of eye-to-eye contact. Also, in one sentence right at the end, readers are told that Willie is found dead at the bottom of an abandoned pit shaft, implying he committed suicide. Of this Anna remains incognizant.  (hide spoiler)] I listened/reread the end several times. Much happens as one approaches the end. The ending is not confusing, but it pushes you stop and think. Is it necessary to reevaluate the conclusions one should draw? Not all is spelled out. I love such endings.The villagers speak in a brogue that was at times difficult for me to comprehend. I always wanted to understand, so I always listened again. The words are made more difficult by the over-dramatization by the audiobook’s narrator. I hesitate to recommend the audiobook narrated by Peter Joyce. I am fine with enhancing a book’s ambiance through authentically replicating spoken brogue, but only if every word can be clearly deciphered. I often went back and listened several times. A good narration should not demand this. Furthermore, Joyce exaggerates the intonations of the wicked and mean and even some of the elderly, making them sound like witches. Children are not properly intoned either. Only those who want an audiobook read with lots of dramatization could possibly like this narration. In a generous mood, I am willing to give the narration at the most two stars. I will be reading more by Arnold Bennett. In his youth he lived in the area described here. This shows. My next book by the author will be The Old Wives' Tale.\n",

      "This was my first experience with Arnold Bennett’s fiction; I’d previously read his Literary Taste. (He is not to be confused, as I’ve done in the past, with novelist and playwright Alan Bennett (An Uncommon Reader, etc.)!) Bennett (1867–1931) was from the Potteries region of Staffordshire and moved to London in his early twenties to work in a law office. Anna of the Five Towns (1902) was his second novel and first moderate success, but it was The Old Wives’ Tale (1908) and the Clayhanger trilogy (1910–16) that truly made his name.Bennett was a contemporary of D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Thomas Hardy (though Hardy had given up on novels by that point), and Anna reminds me of each of these authors to an extent – but particularly of Lawrence, what with his working-class Midlands roots. I also frequently thought of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (religious angst) and Far from the Madding Crowd (a heroine who faces romantic entanglements and financial responsibility for the first time).Twenty-year-old Anna Tellwright is a Methodist Sunday school teacher and lives with her twelve-year-old sister, Agnes, and their ill-tempered father, Ephraim, in “Bursley” (Bennett’s name for Burslem, now part of Stoke-on-Trent). The family is well off thanks to Ephraim’s canny property investments and inheritances he and his late wife received. Yet Anna is still dumbfounded to learn, on her twenty-first birthday, that she’s worth £50,000. Ephraim, generally referred to as “the miser” – there’s no nuance here; he’s typecast and never rises above the label – is happy to turn over certain aspects of the business to Anna, like hounding their tenants the Prices for late rent, but doesn’t give her autonomy over her daily spending. She must meekly approach her father each time she wants to purchase something for herself.Anna has a suitor, Henry Mynors, whose business Ephraim supports as a sleeping partner. She loves the idea of being loved – and the suspicion that she has unwittingly wrenched a desirable prospect away from pretty Beatrice Sutton. But she doesn’t seem to be truly in love with Henry, just like her heart isn’t fully committed to the local revival put on by the Methodists. After all, she hasn’t had the emotional conversion experience that would prove irrefutably that she is saved. Much as she beats herself up over her so-called sins, the desired transformation never arrives. Instead, the closest thing she has to an epiphany comes when she’s standing atop a hill on the Isle of Man on her first-ever holiday:She perceived that the monotony, the austerity, the melancholy of her existence had been sweet and beautiful of its kind, and she recalled, with a sort of rapture, hours of companionship with the beloved Agnes, when her father was equable and pacific. Nothing was ugly nor mean. Beauty was everywhere, in everything.The Prices take on unforeseen significance in the novel, and in her dealings with them Anna is caught between a wish to be Christlike in her compassion and the drive to act as the shrewd businesswoman her father expects. Though she is eventually able to wrest back something like financial independence, she remains bound by the social convention of marrying well.Anna is more timid and introspective than your average heroine; I felt great sympathy for her not in spite of but because of those character traits. I recently took the Myers-Briggs test for the first time, and wondered if Anna could be an ISTJ like me – she dreads having to visit her pupils’ homes and make small talk with the parents, comes across as curt when nervous, and can’t seem to turn her brain off and just feel instead.There’s a lack of subtlety to Bennett’s writing, something I particularly noted in the physical descriptions (“She was tall, but not unusually so, and sturdily built up. Her figure, though the bust was a little flat, had the lenient curves of absolute maturity”) and some heavy-handed foreshadowing (“It was on the very night after this eager announcement that the approaching tragedy came one step nearer”). But I can let him off considering that this was published 115 years ago. It’s an excellent example of regional literature (can you think of another book set in Staffordshire?), with Anna’s visit to Henry’s pottery works a particular highlight. Bennett takes an unpromising setting and rather humble people and becomes their bard:Nothing could be more prosaic than the huddled, red-brown streets; nothing more seemingly remote from romance. Yet be it said that romance is even here—Several miles away, the blast-furnaces of Cauldron Bar Ironworks shot up vast wreaths of yellow flame with canopies of tinted smoke. Still more distant were a thousand other lights crowning chimney and kiln, and nearer, on the waste lands west of Bleakridge, long fields of burning ironstone glowed with all the strange colours of decadence. The entire landscape was illuminated and transformed by these unique pyrotechnics of labour atoning for its grime, and dull, weird sounds, as of the breathings and sighings of gigantic nocturnal creatures, filled the enchanted air.The tea, made specially magnificent in honour of the betrothal, was such a meal as could only have been compassed in Staffordshire or Yorkshire—a high tea of the last richness and excellence, exquisitely gracious to the palate, but ruthless in its demands on the stomach. At one end of the table … was a fowl which had been boiled for four hours; at the other, a hot pork-pie, islanded in liquor, which might have satisfied a regiment. Between these two dishes were … hot pikelets, hot crumpets, hot toast, sardines with tomatoes, raisin-bread, currant-bread, seed-cake, lettuce, home-made marmalade and home-made jams. The repast occupied over an hour, and even then not a quarter of the food was consumed.I enjoyed this for the pacey plot, the religious theme, the sympathetic protagonist, and the loving look at an industrial area. I’ll certainly be looking out for copies of Bennett’s other novels in secondhand bookshops; meanwhile, Project Gutenberg also has a good selection of his writings. Originally published with images on my blog, Bookish Beck.\n",

      "On this occasion, judging a book by its cover worked out very well for me. My eye was initially caught by the title – I still have a childish fondness for characters with my name. Then the arresting self-portrait by Gwen John on the cover convinced me to buy it for 50p from a charity shop. I’d maybe half-heard of the title ‘Anna of the Five Towns’, without having any specific preconceptions. In form and content it reminded me of The Rector's Daughter and The Post-Office Girl, both sensitive and beautifully written portraits of young women constrained by circumstance. The titular Anna acts as housekeeper for her wealthy miser of a father and her younger sister. Like The Rector's Daughter, ‘Anna of Five Towns’ has a relatively sparse plot, as it concentrates on Anna’s inner life. I found her a sympathetic and involving protagonist as she deals with her domineering father, her faith, and a suitor. Her calm, caution, and competence are admirable.Bennett is clearly a writer of skill and the rural Victorian (possibly early Edwardian?) setting is shown in exquisite detail. There’s an extended scene in which Anna tours a pottery works and sees the step by step process of clay becoming a new dinner plate which especially stood out. It may not sound particularly compelling, but I was rather beguiled by the whole thing. The book feels like a window into a previous age, not sparing its darker sides. Indeed, the treatment of indebtedness was very powerful and reminded me of Zola. Although ‘Anna of the Five Towns’ is much gentler than Germinal, one of least gentle books I’ve ever read, it throws rural poverty into stark relief. Anna herself is in a paradoxical situation: her family are landlords and very well-off, while she personally has no access to any of this wealth. Thanks to her father, she has no servants, shabby home-made clothes, and a strict housekeeping budget. This position allows her to feel considerable empathy with tenants unable to pay their rent, although she isn’t an unrealistic paragon. On this theme:The elaborate mechanism by which capital yields interest without suffering diminution from its original bulk is one of the commonest phenomena of modern life, and one of the least understood. Many capitalists never grasp it, nor experience the slightest curiosity about it until the mechanism through some defect ceases to revolve. Tellwright [Anna’s father] was of these, […] But to Anna, who had some imagination, and whose imagination was stirred by recent events, the arrival of moneys out of space, unearned, unasked, was a disturbing experience, affecting her as a conjuring trick affects a child, whose sensations hesitate between pleasure and apprehension. Practically, Anna could not believe that she was rich; and in fact she was not rich – she was merely a fixed point through which moneys that she was unable to arrest passed with the rapidity of trains.As well as such commentary, the writing also imbues the settings with a wonderful level of texture. My favourite example was the page-long description of a sideboard, of which this is only a part:In it was reflected the conscientious labour of generations. It had a soft and assuaged appearance, as though it had never been new and could never have been new. All its corners and edges had long lost the asperities of manufacture, and its smooth surfaces were marked by slight hollows similar in spirit to those worn by the naked feet of pilgrims into the marble steps of a shrine. I loved ‘Anna of the Five Towns’ and would certainly read something else by Bennett. It was also pleasant to read an older novel for the first time in a little while; I think my fiction choices have been too modern recently. Anna is a protagonist who will linger in my mind long after this brief insight into her life, along with Mary Joyceln and Christine Hoflehner.\n",

      "I loved this novel because, as I heard somewhere, it raised the ordinary to extraordinary.And that's exactly what makes this a thrilling novel. Nothing exceptional goes on, just what life for a young woman in an industrial village at the end of the XIX century might have been like. Unadorned and real.Anna is an ordinary girl, who leads a simple existence with her tyrannical father and her younger half sister. She performs her duties without complaint, without any fuss or expectations. She is humble and austere and shy and not sure of what religion or love means, even though society imposes them on her. When she turns 21, her oppressive father announces that she 's come into a great inheritance left to her from her deceased mother which makes her a wealthy and eligible woman. But that doesn't change anything, she is still depending on her miserly father.Although Anna consents into everything imposed to her, she kind of starts making her own decisions to thread her future. While receiving constant attention from Henry Mynors, a young promising businessman, who wants to marry her, she can't help thinking of poor and humble Willie Prince, one of her tenants who is in deep debt. Her first own decision might change life as she had known it.The end of the story left me breathless, so many emotions in such a few lines, without great passion, only with open sincerity, only with the pouring hearts of two people who are destined not to be together, and their cold acceptance to take life as it is. Hard, unfair and sad.Great first experience of Bennett's writing. I'll read more by him definitely!\n",

      "Anna Tellwright is one of my favourite heroines, coming a close third after Emma Bovary and Tess Durbeyfield. Arnold Bennett, like Hardy, depicts his heroine with warmth and affection, compassionate in her suffering and tolerant of her faults. Writing this novel before D.H. Lawrence's Brangwen novels were published, but working with similar settings, characters and themes, Bennett puts before us poor, narrow-minded and bigoted communities, but he never loses his sense of fun, exaggerating Ephraim's accent, drawing our attention to idiosyncracies of dress and behaviour in his characters and letting, with some enjoyment, those in the wrong arrive at their just desserts. Only at the end is there a wistful sense of his inability to change the course he has plotted for Anna... but I won't give that away.\n",

It's a powerful turn of the 20th century novel set in the Potteries, which is said to have been influenced by Balzac and has a similarly grim, closed-in feeling. The heroine, Anna, is the daughter of a rich but miserly businessman, who delights in controlling every aspect of her life, and wants to turn her into someone in his image - but she yearns to escape.

      "At first, this seemed wooden and dated, a pale imitation of Trollope or Eliot, who had been writing in a similar vein two generations earlier. Initially, I found the main source of interest in the detailed descriptions of the industrial landscape of \"The Five Towns\", a kind of verbal Lowry, if the latter had painted the Potteries rather than Manchester.Then, I became hooked by Bennett's portrayal of the main characters, which in time seemed to me more realistic and telling than his more celebrated Victorian forerunners. We know that Anna's relationship with the suave and capable Mynors will not follow a simple and happy path, since the author begins to hint at future tragedy, but will this be dramatic or subtly understated?Competent, self-contained but inexperienced, Anna has been understandably dominated by her miserly tyrant of a father who has been punctilious in growing the fortune left her by her deceased mother, but cannot bring himself to give her free access to the money, only arbitrary duties such as his brutal insistence that she pursues rent arrears on one of her properties. Denied a normal, loving upbringing, it is hardly surprising that Anna find it difficult to establish a spontaneous romantic relationship with Mynors. She admires him, even imagines him in her bed, but it is only a matter of time before she comprehends that life with him means exchanging one tyrant for another, admittedly more benevolent than her father. It is easier for her to extend the maternal love she feels for her young sister to a weak, inept man who needs her support.Bennett also proves clear-eyed over the materialism and hyprocrisy of some of the pillars of the local Methodist community, which exerts as great a domination on poor Anna as does her father. He describes with wry insight how the community deals with the suicide of a leading church member , \"an abject yet heroic surrender of all those pretences by which society contrives to tolerate itself. Here was a man whom no one respected, but everyone pretended to respect - who knew he was respected by none, but pretended that he was respected by all..... If any man could have been trusted to continue the decent sham to the end and so preserve the general self-esteem, surely it was this man. But no! Suddenly abandoning all imposture, he transgresses openly....snatching a piece of hemp cries, `Behold me; this is real human nature. This is the truth; the rest was lies. I lied;you lied. I confess it, and you shall confess it.'\"Comment Comment | Permalink \n",

      "Anna of the Five Towns is an example of an intrinsically Victorian genre, the Industrial Novel, and as such can be read on the political as well as the personal level. Bennett’s novel was published in 1902 when industrialisation was firmly entrenched in British society. The Five Towns are a fictionalised Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, centre of the English ceramics industry known as ‘the potteries’. Bennett grew up in Staffordshire, but left it for London as a young man. Although no doubt he continued to visit, he never again lived there. However, we can see from this book that his childhood home left a deep impression on him. Bennett describes the Five Towns in loving detail. By day it might be a dirty townscape of pottery works and coal mines, but by night it is lit by distant fires which give it a fairyland glamour. We see the Five Towns through the point of view of Anna Tellwright, who comes of age during the course of this novel. Anna is the daughter of a hardhearted miser who exacts total submission from his daughters. Unlike other Industrial Novels, this book is not about the relationship between owners and workers, with the working class forming merely a backdrop to the action. Anna’s own development and her relationships are very much the focus of this book, but in the background Bennett explores the workings of the middle class and especially how its subtle economic gradations are acted out within the unifying force of evangelical religion. All the characters co-operate as stalwarts of the church, but their relationships on the economic front are very different. When one of their number is facing ruin none of them lifts a finger to help him while Tellwright gleefully pushes them to the wall. They see the laws of economics as being as inexorable as the laws of God. Anna alone has pity on them and tries to help, but her efforts come to nothing and their fate is inevitable. However, along the way she quite unexpectedly finds love.In a way, Anna of the Five Towns is about the damaging effects of capitalism on the human soul, but while we the readers see its inhumanity, it is not acknowledged by the characters, but disguised behind a veneer of evangelical piety. \n",

      "I picked up this book in a used bookstore in Preston, England, knowing nothing about Bennett. And while I enjoyed the writing and particularly some of the family portraits he lays out, the crux of the book -- Anna's relationships with men -- doesn't quite work for me (don't worry, no spoiler alert needed).Anna lives in one of the \"Five Towns\" near Liverpool renowned for their pottery making and coal mining, and Bennett does not spare the cityscapes from caustic descriptions. Her father is a miser and a tyrant, having outlived both his daughters' mothers and now making his money through real estate and investments. If dinner is not served precisely, an explosion and a night of shunning ensues. Anna learns from him that she is coming into an inheritance that makes her a wealthy woman, yet she must still beg him for shopping money (until a fateful act of rebellion late in the story). Meanwhile, she is being pursued in an oh so decorous fashion by one of the most eligible bachelors and up and coming entrepreneurs in the city. Anna's particular cross to bear, though, even more than the gossips of the Methodist church society, is that one of her inheritances is a disheveled piece of property owned by the Sunday School superintendent, a lugubrious and hypocritically moralistic man who is always behind on the rent, and whose shambling, awkward son is often sent down to deliver what payments he can.This becomes the basis for what will pass for a crisis at the conclusion of this book, and I leave it to you to decide whether Bennett makes that work. For me, the careful development of his characters and descriptions never built up a solid foundation for the dramatic ending, so I couldn't end up giving this raves, even though I think the portrait of Anna's father is one of the most disgustingly compelling ones around.\n",

      "The further I got into this book, the more impressed I became. Not just by the novel itself, but by the fact it was written by a man. It's such a sensitive and powerful portrayal of daughter-to-father obedience/loyalty vs. the struggle of personal conscience and sense of justice. Anna is such an appealing woman, similar to Jane Eyre in her strong sense of individuality and resistance to pressure from any quarter. I loved the revival scenes - how often do you get to see the negative side of good peer pressure? And her frank assessment of Mynors - ! She got more complex as the novel continued. I wasn't crazy about the ending, only because it didn't seem like the end yet. This is one of those rare books (like Jane Eyre was for me as a teen) that is just full of insight applicable to real life. Wish I had read it long ago. I highly recommend it. \n",

Arnold Bennett has such a wonderful way of capturing the way people think and speak - or rather as they thought and spoke 100 years ago.I used to live in the Stoke on Trent area and am at home with the dialect words and phrases. Also with the area. Arnold Bennett uses slightly fictionalised names for the towns (Bursley instead of Burslem, for instance) and streets (Trafalgar Street instead of Waterloo Road) so anybody familiar with the area knows exactly where his characters live, where they tread.During my recent walk from SW France to NW England (Vic's Big Walk, followed by the book of the same name)I walked the length of Trafalgar/Waterloo and also had a nostalgic mosey around Bursley/Burslem. Anna of the Five Towns is an enjoyable and informative read and also helped me to continue last year's experience.\n",

      "In the last year I have read two powerful novels by Arnold Bennett, Anna of the Five Towns and The Old Wives’ Tale. Both books are first rate, and I wonder why Bennett is not more widely known. Anna of the Five Towns tells the story of the struggle of a young woman to gain independence from her miserly and controlling father at the end of the nineteenth century. (She succeeds but pays a price) The Old Wives’ Tale tells the intertwining stories of two sisters over the space of a lifetime and is really a masterpiece. However, I find myself wondering how it is that Bennett chose to work with female protagonists in these novels and whether this is typical or atypical of his work. I suppose I will have to keep reading more Arnold Bennett to come up with an explanation.\n",

      "I really loved this and despite the fact she had a pretty unhappy life - tyrannical father, loveless marriage, death of the man she loves - I still think it is an uplifting story as even while she is pragmatic she never really let go of her morals and values and I think she will be strong enough to survive on her own terms. So loved this.\n",
